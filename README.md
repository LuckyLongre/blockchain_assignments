---

### Technologies Used:

* **Solidity** (Smart Contract Language)
* **Remix IDE** (Online Solidity Compiler & Deployer)
* **MetaMask** (for address-based testing - optional)

---

### Smart Contract Features:

1. **Multiple Candidates**
   Candidates are initialized at the time of contract deployment.

2. **One Vote per Address**
   A voter can vote only once. The contract keeps track of voters using their address.

3. **Vote Counting**
   The system counts the number of votes received by each candidate.

4. **Public Access**
   Anyone can read the number of votes each candidate has received.

---

### Contract Code:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract VotingSystem {
    address public owner;
    string[] public candidateList;
    mapping(string => uint256) public votesReceived;
    mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;

    constructor(string[] memory candidateNames) {
        owner = msg.sender;
        candidateList = candidateNames;
    }

    function vote(string memory candidate) public {
        require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "You have already voted!");
        require(validCandidate(candidate), "Candidate does not exist!");

        votesReceived[candidate] += 1;
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
    }

    function getVotes(string memory candidate) public view returns (uint256) {
        require(validCandidate(candidate), "Candidate does not exist!");
        return votesReceived[candidate];
    }

    function validCandidate(string memory candidate) internal view returns (bool) {
        for (uint i = 0; i < candidateList.length; i++) {
            if (keccak256(bytes(candidateList[i])) == keccak256(bytes(candidate))) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    function totalCandidates() public view returns (uint256) {
        return candidateList.length;
    }
}
```

---

### Steps to Deploy (Using Remix IDE):

1. Open [https://remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org).
2. Create a new file named `VotingSystem.sol` and paste the above code.
3. Compile the code using the **Solidity Compiler** tab.
4. Go to the **Deploy & Run** tab:

   * In the constructor input, pass candidate names like:
     `["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]`
   * Click **Deploy**.

---

### Sample Function Usage:

* `vote("Alice")` â€” Cast your vote to Alice.
* `getVotes("Alice")` â€” See total votes for Alice.

- Use of Solidity **modifiers** to implement access control.


### Technologies Used:

- **Solidity** (Smart Contract Language)
- **Remix IDE** (Online Solidity Compiler & Deployer)
- **MetaMask** (for address-based testing - optional)


### Smart Contract Features:

1. **Owner Identification**: Stores the deployerâ€™s address as the contract owner.
2. **Access Restriction**: Uses a `modifier` to restrict certain function(s) to the owner only.
3. **Secure Execution**: Unauthorized users cannot execute restricted functions.


### Contract Code:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract OwnerOnlyFunction {

    address public owner;

    // Set the deployer as the owner
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    // Modifier to restrict access to only the owner
    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Access denied: Only owner can call this function.");
        _;
    }

    // Function only the owner can call
    function secretFunction() public onlyOwner {
        // logic only owner can execute
    }
}
```


### Steps to Deploy (Using Remix IDE):

1. Open [https://remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
2. Create a new file named `OwnerOnlyFunction.sol` and paste the above code.
3. Compile the code using the **Solidity Compiler** tab.
4. Go to the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab and click **Deploy**.


### Sample Function Usage:

- `secretFunction()` â€” Only callable by the contract owner.


### Expected Output:

- If the function is called by anyone other than the deployer (owner), the contract will throw an error: `Access denied: Only owner can call this function.`


### Conclusion:

This contract demonstrates how to implement role-based access control in smart contracts using **modifiers**, ensuring secure execution of sensitive functions by the owner only.

- The auction can be ended by the owner.


### Technologies Used:

- **Solidity** (Smart Contract Language)
- **Remix IDE** (Online Solidity Compiler & Deployer)
- **MetaMask** (for interacting with the contract)


### Smart Contract Features:

1. **Placing Bids**: Users can place bids with Ether. Bids must be higher than the current highest bid.
2. **Tracking Top Bidder**: Stores the address and amount of the highest bidder.
3. **End Auction**: Only the owner can end the auction and transfer funds.
4. **Refunding Previous Highest Bidder**: Automatically refunds the previous highest bid when outbid.


### Contract Code:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleAuction {
    address public owner;
    address public highestBidder;
    uint public highestBid;
    bool public auctionEnded;

    mapping(address => uint) public pendingReturns;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    // Place a bid
    function bid() public payable {
        require(!auctionEnded, "Auction already ended.");
        require(msg.value > highestBid, "There already is a higher bid.");

        if (highestBid != 0) {
            // Refund the previous highest bidder
            pendingReturns[highestBidder] += highestBid;
        }

        highestBidder = msg.sender;
        highestBid = msg.value;
    }

    // Withdraw overbid amounts
    function withdraw() public returns (bool) {
        uint amount = pendingReturns[msg.sender];
        require(amount > 0, "No funds to withdraw.");

        pendingReturns[msg.sender] = 0;

        if (!payable(msg.sender).send(amount)) {
            pendingReturns[msg.sender] = amount;
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }

    // End the auction
    function endAuction() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can end the auction.");
        require(!auctionEnded, "Auction already ended.");

        auctionEnded = true;
        payable(owner).transfer(highestBid);
    }
}
```


### Steps to Deploy (Using Remix IDE):

1. Go to [https://remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
2. Create a new file named `SimpleAuction.sol` and paste the code above.
3. Compile it using **Solidity Compiler**.
4. Deploy it using the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab.


### Sample Function Usage:

- `bid()` â€” Place a bid by entering Ether value in the VALUE field.
- `withdraw()` â€” Previous bidders can withdraw their funds.
- `endAuction()` â€” Owner ends the auction and receives the highest bid.


### Expected Output:

- Only higher bids are accepted.
- Previous top bidders are refunded.
- Owner can end the auction and receive funds.


### Conclusion:

This basic auction contract enables transparent and competitive bidding. Solidity ensures secure bid handling, automatic refunds, and owner-controlled auction finalization.
